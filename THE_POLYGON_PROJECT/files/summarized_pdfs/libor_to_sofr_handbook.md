"LIBOR Transition Playbook 2023: Fannie Mae, Floating-Rate Loans (Freddie Mac), and Securities .
Multifamily ARMs (Fannie Mae), Floating- Rate Loans, and Securities. The LIBOR transition timelines.
The table below includes the table below .

The playbook details the list of changes since the January 2023 version of the LIBOR Transition
Playbook was published on the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac websites . The playbook is preliminary
and subject to revision and updates from time to time .

The GSEs are jointly publishing this LIBOR Transition Playbook to assist stakeholders in preparing for
the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates . LIBOR is the most widely used global interest
rate benchmark, and it is deeply embedded in global financial products . The long-term viability of
LIBOR has been undermined due to cases of rate-manipulation and low volumes for underlying
interbank transactions .

Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC’s) recommended SOFR as a benchmark replacement
for USD LIBOR-indexed contracts . SOFR is an overnight interest rate based on USD Treasury
repurchase agreements . LIBOR Act was signed into law on March 15, 2022 .

The Financial AccountingStandards Board (FASB) issued a final accounting standard update to provide
temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in transitioning from LIBOR . The transition may have
an impact on the accounting treatment for existing contracts, hedge-relationships, or other transactions
that reference LIBOR. The transition of legacy LIBOR-indexed transactions may result in tax
implications.

Figure 2-2 depicts LIBOR benchmark replacements and spread adjustment methodology for consumer
products as defined by the LIBOR Act . The scenarios included below provide the expected payments
and interest rate reset mechanics for LIBOR-indexed ARMs with different characteristics .

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will work with each servicer individually to determine how to best manage
through the transition away from LIBOR on any non-standard notes . Servicers have been encouraged
to initially focus their reviews on older vintages of loans, loans originated by Sellers no longer in
business .

The LIBOR transition impacts MBS/PCs consisting of pools of LIBOR-indexed ARMs . For Fannie Mae,
SF MBS subtypes and index codes will not change; however, index descriptions associated with
subtypes will be updated to reflect the transition to the replacement indices .
The GSEs defined key milestones related to the transition of legacy LIBOR-indexed MF ARMs,
Floating-Rate Loans and securities . The LIBOR Act required the Board to publish regulations
identifying a Board-selected benchmark replacement based on SOFR . On December 16, 2022, the
Board published its final rulemaking confirming the LIBOR benchmark replacements .

The SOFR-based rate replacing LIBOR on legacy Multifamily LIBOR-based loans and securities
consists of 30-day Average SOFR plus the applicable fixed tenor spread adjustment for 12-month
LIBOR (0.71513%) For updates on regulatory and industry efforts to advance the legacy transition,
refer to the Board's final rulemaking and ARRC’s website . Servicers have been encouraged to initially
focus their reviews on older vintages of loans

LIBOR-indexed MBS/PCs/K-Deals will also transition to 30-day Average SOFR with a fixed tenor
spreadadjustment as defined in the LIBOR Act . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expect that each interest
rate cap provider will select a benchmark replacement . The borrower’s obligation to purchase
replacement interest rate caps as required by loan documents is unaffected .

The following dates are the critical transition dates for Freddie Mac MBS/PCs/K-Deals*. Freddie Mac
Multifamily securities will all transition to a spread-adjusted 30-Day Average SOFR rate . Freddie Mac
MF does not plan to issue any LIBOR-indexed CRT deals in the future .

The GSEs will transition from 1-month LIBOR to the 30-day average SOFR rate published by the NY
Fed, plus an applicable tenor spread adjustment (0.11448% for one month-tenor) as defined in the
LIBOR Act . Investors and vendors will need to maintain awareness of potential impacts of LIBOR
transition including index and calculation changes .

The GSEs will transition from 1-month LIBOR to the 30-day average SOFR rate published by the NY
Fed, plus an applicable tenor spread adjustment (0.11448% for one month-tenor) The following
sections serve as a tool to help plan and adapt business policies, procedures, and processes to support
products linked to ARRs .

The GSEs have taken the following steps, under FHFA’s guidance, to prepare for the transition . Figure
7-1 identifies key transition milestones for SF ARMs . Fannie Mae began accepting delivery of
SOFR-indexed ARMs on August 3, 2020, and Freddie Mac began underwriting them on October 1,
2020 .
Fannie Mae has updated ARM plans and a Special Feature code (“SFC”) in support of the transition to
SOFR, as detailed in Figure 7-3 . Freddie Mac has updated Cash Contract and Guarantor Pooling
Products to support SOFR- indexed ARMs (Freddie Mac)

GSEs have made multiple specification updates in the latest versions of their automated underwriting
systems (“AUS”) in support of SOFR ARMs . SOFR-indexed ARMs are based on 30-day Average
SOFR, as published by the NY Fed, which is a compounded average of overnight SOFR over the
preceding 30 calendar days .

The minimum initial fixed period for SOFR loans is three years . The GSEs have updated their
respective ULDD specifications in support of SOFR ARMs . The processes for selling and delivering
SOFR-indexed ARMs is the same as the processes used to sell and deliver ARMs tied to any other
index .

The GSEs have updated reference product labels, ARM plans, subtypes and pool prefixes for new
SOFR-indexed MBS/PCs . Sellers should submit one of the published SOFR ARM plan numbers in the
ULDD sent to Loan Delivery and/or N/A earlyCheck .

The purpose of this chapter is to provide market participants with market guidance on the transition of
legacy LIBOR-indexed SFCRT transactions in the future . As of December 31, 2020, the GSEs stopped
purchasing LIBOR indexed SF LIBOR ARMs .

The GSEs are aligned on the choice of SOFR indexes that will be utilized for future SF CRT securities .
The move to SOFR-indexed discounting by CME/LCH has helped improve the liquidity of the SOFR
derivatives market . The ARRC endorsed SOFR as its recommended benchmark replacement to
LIBOR in anticipation of LIBOR's cessation .

The GSEs will accept all collateral that is currently acceptable for new-issue SOFR-indexed CMOs .
The Determination Date for 45-day, 55-day and 75-day Delay and Non-Delay securities based on
30-day Average SOFR is 2BD prior to the beginning of the accrual period .

Fannie Mae began purchasing SOFR-indexed ARMs on September 1, 2020 and stopped purchasing
and securitizing LIBOR-indexing ARMs at the end of 2020 . Multifamily is engaging with third-party
interest rate cap providers to understand developments in the market for third party interest rate caps .
Fannie Mae has created new ARM plans and subtypes to support SOFR-indexed ARM MBS . New
pool prefixes have been added to the Pool Prefix glossary and are described in Figure 10-4 .

SoFR-indexed MBS issued by Fannie Mae include new attributes to facilitate securitization and
accurate disclosure in the capital markets . Investors should understand the differences between
LIBOR- and SOFR-Indexed ARMs that underpin the MBS they invest in .

Fannie Mae has not yet issued its first SOFR-indexed MF CRT issuance but is technically ready to do
so . Freddie Mac's Multifamily SCR Notes program is looking to attract large investors from STACR.
Thus, alignment with SF CRT is essential to ensure broad market acceptance .

Freddie Mac will use the NY Fed’s published rates on its website for index determination . Freddie Mac
Multifamily priced its first floating-rate K-Deal (KF73) with bonds indexed to SOFR and LIBOR-indexed
loans in December 2019 .

Freddie Mac provides a Basis Risk Guarantee to cover any basis mismatch between SOFR-indexed
bonds and the LIBOR-SOFR loans . Freddie Mac calculates the SOFR rate based on a calendar month
compound average using the NY Fed’s published index. Freddie Mac discloses the applicable SOFR
rates on its website .

The current LIBOR-SOFR bonds have a LIBOR Determination Date the business day prior to the Loan
Interest Accrual. Period . The SOFR index applicable to the bonds in K-F73 through . KF SOFR bonds
with SOFR-indexed . collateralized loans . Freddie Mac Multifamily began offering SOFR . bonds on
September 1, 2020 .

The applicable SOFR rate is 30-day Average SOFR, which is published by the NY Fed . Interest due to
SOFR-SOFR bond classes will be calculated “in advance” of interest being due . Freddie Mac may not
offer Class BL or BS classes . If Class BL and BS are not offered, Classes AL and AS may extend to
7.5% credit enhancement level .

Freddie Mac has only issued floating-rate Multi PCs indexed to LIBOR in the past . Freddie Mac does
not anticipate there will be any impact to the following: Servicer reporting and remittance deadlines .
Servicers will need to become familiar with SOFR index calculation protocols and ensure primary
servicers are equally capable of processing rate changes .

Freddie Mac Multifamily securities will all transition to a spread-adjusted 30-Day Average SOFR rate
with some nuances to consider . Legacy Floating-Rate K-Deals through KF72, Floating- Rate Multi
PCs® and Q008 – These deals include certificates and underlying loans indexed to 1MO LIBOR .
Legacy Small Balance FRESB deals through SB82 (including SB3) – These transactions contain
Hybrid ARMs that have all been converted to floating-rate and are

Hybrid certificates at different tenors (5-, 7-, 7-yr) pay a fixed-rate until the last underlying Hybrid ARM
loan in each related Hybrid . ARM loan group converts to a floating-rate indexed to 6MO LIBOR . Any
excess excess interest will flow to the IO bonds .

Freddie Mac completed its first SOFR-indexed MF CRT issuance, MSCR 2021-MN1, in January 2021 .
The Hybrid bonds will continue to be based on the WAC of the borrowers' loan group .

Fannie Mae has the capability to purchase SOFR-indexed ARMs beginning Sep. 1, 2020 . Freddie Mac
has developed the Structured ARM, 7/6/6, Hybrid ARM and a new MF capped ARM product and
released them on Sep.1, 2020. Updated the graphs in the administration section to indicate that LIBOR
is no longer a hypothetical transitional approach for legacy legacy mortgages .

Fannie Mae has stopped accepting LIBOR-indexed loans with commitment dates after September 30,
2020 . Freddie Mac expects SCR Notes will be a SCR notes for SCR CRT CRT issuance and will be
structured in alignment with the program . Updated figures to reflect the GSEs’ current outstanding
legacy legacy legacy SF CRT notes .

Updated the cessation date of key LIBOR tenors; added the ARRC’s endorsement of the CME Term
SOFR Rates to the list of SOFR milestones with a link to the original announcement . Updated
timelines for SF SOFR ARMs; updated language around 30-day Average SOFR Hybrid
ARM/Mortgages and Index codes and the SF MBS Disclosures Guide . Updated Legacy CRT transition
section to reflect the plan to not issue any LIBORbased

Updated timeline to include year 2022 and tentative plans for a legacy.Securities transition
announcement. Updated margin features for Fannie Mae SF SOFR ARMs. Updated to reflect the
cessation of resecuritizing existing LIBOR-Indexed CMOs and MBS/PCs into new-issuance mortgage
obligations. Shortened section to emphasize similarities to Section 3, “Single-Family Credit.Multifamily"
