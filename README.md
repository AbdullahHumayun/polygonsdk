# Welcome to the Polygon.io toolkit

This is a tool-kit designed for polygon.io users as well as anyone looking to integrate real-time data feeds into their personal Discord servers.

I'll be automating the creation process over-time, such as webhook and channel creation, as well as incorporating a stream-lined way to recieve

Discord feeds based upon your personal preference.


To view more in-depth README - please see the *read-me* folder.


Any questions can be sent to chuckdustin12@gmail.com and I'll do my best to reply promptly.
